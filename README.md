# Expo CLI SDK Version Mismatch or Cache Error

This repository demonstrates a common but tricky error in Expo CLI, often caused by inconsistencies between the Expo CLI version, the project's SDK version, or corrupted cache.

The `expoBug.js` file contains a project setup that might trigger this error (if the SDK version isn't set correctly or the cache is problematic). The `expoBugSolution.js` file provides a solution and various debugging steps.

## Steps to Reproduce the Error (expoBug.js)

1. Ensure your Expo CLI is slightly older than what's recommended for your project (mimicking a version mismatch).
2. Run `expo start`. 
3. (Optional) Introduce a slight modification to the app.json to force a cache update that might conflict.
4. Observe the error.

## Solution (expoBugSolution.js)

1. **Check SDK Version:** Confirm that the SDK version in your `app.json` matches or is compatible with your Expo CLI version.  Use `expo --version` to check CLI version.
2. **Clear Expo Cache:** Run `expo start --clear` or manually delete the Expo cache directory (location varies depending on your OS).
3. **Update Dependencies:**  Review your `package.json` for any dependency conflicts. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to refresh.
4. **Update Expo CLI:** Use `npm install -g expo-cli@latest` to update the Expo CLI to its latest version. If the issue persists after updates, consider reinstalling the Expo CLI.
5. **Check Project Setup:** Ensure you've correctly set up your `app.json` and other project files.  A simple mistake in the file can sometimes cause conflicts.
6. **Reinstall Node Modules:** Try removing `node_modules` folder and then reinstall modules with `npm install` or `yarn install`.
7. **Create a New Project:** If all else fails, creating a new project might be helpful to rule out issues with your existing project setup.  Then carefully transfer code to the new project.
